# LifeSteal

LifeSteal is a unique Minecraft server feature that introduces a dynamic health system based on player interactions. This guide outlines the core mechanics and features of LifeSteal and Life Essence.

## Features

### LifeSteal Mechanics
- **Player Kill:** If you die in combat with another player, you lose a heart, and the attacker gains a heart.
- **Natural Death:** If you die from natural causes (e.g., falling, mobs, drowning), you will not lose hearts.
- **Minimum Health:** If you die with only 1 heart left, the attacker will not gain any hearts since the minimum health is capped at 1.
- **No Banning:** You will not get banned if you die with only 1 heart remaining.

### Life Essence
- **Crafting & Withdrawing:** You can obtain Life Essence either by crafting it or by withdrawing your heart.
